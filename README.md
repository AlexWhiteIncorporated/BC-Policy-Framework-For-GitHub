# BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub
BC Developers' Policy and Guidline Documents - All the information a BC Gvt employee could ever want about GitHub

***
The BCGov GitHub Organization represents an ongoing effort to enable public & private sector, as well at citizen developers, the ability to collaborate on, leverage and integrate technology assets outside of the typical government procurement/contract model.

This repo's content is focused on providing information, examples and guidelines to facilitate the creation and governance of BCGov Open Source projects. 

## Project Status
March 2015: We are at the discovery phase of the project and we are currently collecting material to form the content of this repository. Right now we are also clearing the pathway through Privacy, Legal and Risk Management to ensure GitHub.com is an approved avenue for the Province of British Columbia. Yes - we are keeping that fun to ourselves but there will be lots more to come once we have the green light from the gate keepers.
